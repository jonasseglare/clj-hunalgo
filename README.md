# clj-hunalgo

A Clojure library for solving the [assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) using the [Hungarian algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm). This code is a port of the Java library found here:

https://github.com/aalmi/HungarianAlgorithm/blob/master/HungarianAlgorithm.java

## Usage

Call the function `solve-assignment-problem-ij-pairs` to find the optimum assignment represented as pairs of row and column indices:

```
(require '[clj-hunalgo.core :refer [solve-assignment-problem-ij-pairs]])

(solve-assignment-problem-ij-pairs
 [[1 0 1 1]
  [1 1 0 1]
  [1 1 1 0]
  [0 1 1 1]])
;; => ([0 1] [1 2] [2 3] [3 0])
```
